# Anders Giovanni Møller Machine Learning Repository Template

This repository is a template for a Python-based data science project adapted from the
Alexandra Institute ML Project Template.

## Quickstart

Install Cookiecutter:
```
pip3 install cookiecutter
```

Create a project based on the template (the `-f` flag ensures that you use the newest
version of the template):
```
cookiecutter -f gh:andersgiovanni/ml-template
```


## Features

### Docker Setup

A Dockerfile is included in the new repositories, which by default runs
`src/scripts/main.py`. You can build the Docker image and run the Docker container by
running `make docker`.

### Automatic Documentation

Run `make docs` to create the documentation in the `docs` folder, which is based on
your docstrings in your code. You can view this by running `make view-docs`.

### Automatic Test Coverage Calculation

Run `make test` to test your code, which also updates the "coverage badge" in the
README, showing you how much of your code base that is currently being tested.

### Continuous Integration

Github CI pipelines are included in the repo, running all the tests in the `tests`
directory, as well as building online documentation if Github Pages has been enabled
for the repository (can be enabled on Github in the repository settings).

### Code Spaces

Code Spaces is a new feature on Github that allows you to develop on a project
completely in the cloud, without having to do any local setup at all. This repo comes
included with a configuration file for running code spaces on Github. When hosted on
`andersgiovanni/<project-name>`, simply press the `<> Code` button and add a code space
to get started, which will open a VSCode window directly in your browser.
